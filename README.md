# What Can I Cook

## Our goal

In this time of quarantine, we asked ourselves, what most people who are currently not working will do with their time ?
And the answer is, spend more time together, eating and drinking together...
Our goal is simple, give those people the opportunity to cook and prepare cocktails without even having to think of 
recipes. They will be able to find a recipe with what they already have, without having to go out to buy new ingredients.

## Functionalities 

### Must Have

-	A home page
-	A cocktail page with a search bar so that the user can search for cocktail recipes with ingredients keywords
-	A food page with a search bar so that the user can search for food recipes with ingredients keywords

### Should Have

-	A cocktail page with a list of cocktails to give the user ideas
-	A food recipe page with a list of dishes

### Nice to Have 

- Seasonal categories (for example : Christmas Recipes)
- Let the users rate the recipes
- Sorting the recipes by popularity
